## Reflection – Weight Tracker App

The Weight Tracker app was built to help users log their daily weight, set a personal goal, and receive a text notification once that goal is reached. The goal was to make progress tracking simple, motivating, and accessible.  

To support these needs, I included core screens for account creation, daily weight entry, and a progress view. I kept the UI clean with clear buttons and readable text so users could quickly find what they need. These design choices made the app user‑centered and easy to navigate.  

I approached coding step by step, testing each feature as I built it. This incremental process helped me catch bugs early and keep the project manageable. Testing confirmed that the app’s functionality worked as intended and revealed small usability improvements I could make.  

One challenge I faced was restructuring the project after earlier feedback. Rebuilding from scratch with clearer structure and comments improved both the code and my confidence as a developer. I was especially successful in implementing the goal‑tracking and notification feature, which demonstrated my ability to combine user‑centered design with functional coding.  

Overall, this project showed me how to connect user needs with design and development, and it reflects my growth in building apps that are both practical and user‑friendly.
